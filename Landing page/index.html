              Helping people get where they want to be in life is my passion. Formerly in Human Resources and Talent Acquisition,
             I’ve taken part in the hiring process from the perspective of the business and am uniquely suited to help you get that 
             next promotion or help you advance to a more rewarding career and position.

        <p class="lead">
          I help people transition to a more rewarding career through professional development & career coaching.
          Throughout my career, I’ve learned that people who are not clear about what they want to do in life often don’t make the best decisions.  
          If that sounds like you, you are not alone.  My goal is to support you in your discovery process and to help you move forward into the 
          right career direction and position.
          Some people I talk to know what they want to do, but don’t know how to get there. Without a clear path to get to the end goal, 
          it’s hard to know where to begin, much less what to do. This can often cause people to do nothing. 
          You may be wondering if you should stay in your current position or if it’s time to move on? As a career coach, I can help you assess 
          whether there’s room for growth with your current position/employer or if your unique skills could be applied in a more fulfilling role. 
          The hardest thing to overcome is feeling like you’ve done everything right, but realizing you aren’t getting anywhere.
           It’s not readily apparent what could be improved in your approach. It takes someone with experience in how the hiring and promotion process
          works internally. As a former HR Advisor, I’m uniquely qualified to share the inner workings about how candidates are picked for interviews 
         and why they get hired.
          The first step in making a positive change in your life & career TODAY is to schedule a complimentary career coaching session with me.
          If you’re curious about learning more, I want to talk to you! Let’s find out if career coaching is right for you.
